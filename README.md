- I know it's painful every time you open secondary or multi-level folders. This plugin will free you from that.
- In the settings, fill in emojis. For example, if you enter "🗃️,📂,📁", all documents with these three emojis will be treated as sub-notebooks. You can click to expand them, and clicking won't enter the document (but your data won't be lost).
- If you fill in a document ID in the settings, that document will be treated as a sub-notebook. You can click to expand it, and clicking won't enter the document (but your data won't be lost).
